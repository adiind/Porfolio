Here’s my top 3 recent sculptures (they’re a year old), all 3 combined follow a ladder of expression and realism.\nThe Drake is a mythical creature and allowed me to present my take on it, there is no one exact form and allowed for unrestricted expression all the while trying to make him look realistic.\nThe skull is deeply rooted in realism and the form is already set, my experiment in expression here led to the intrigued look.\nThe overthinker is a culmination of the learnings from its predecessors. First it takes inspiration from Auguste rodin‘s The Thinker which portrays contemplation and introspection, then it takes it a notch above - the additional hands add to thought process, taking away from pure contemplation to being stuck in the contemplative loop, the moot process of overthinking. The pokémon Machamp fit here perfectly, might of the fighter pokémon stuck in introspective loop throws some shade at the artist himself. The 2D creature had to be imagined in 3D with realistic anatomy - it drew realism where there was none. The expression here is profound, for me it shows the powerlessness of powerful beings in their pursuit of perfection.\n\nYou should trust the process, and before the process you must trust yourself to be the person who follows through the process",

Here’s why I prefer it with Home Assistant:\n\n1. **Custom Firmware**: ESPHome builds firmware specifically for your ESP devices, tailored to your needs and fitting budget.\n \n2. **Easy Integration**: Once set up, devices are automatically detected and managed by Home Assistant, allowing for real-time control. You can even update it OTA.\n\n3. **No Coding Needed**: Instead of writing complex code, you just use simple YAML files to configure your devices. ESPHome does the rest. Almost no code, it’s similar to JSON editing.\n\n4. **Quick Setup**: Adding new sensors or devices is as easy as updating a file and reloading. Home Assistant picks them up right away.

Here’s what we did and why:\n\n🔍 **Why Move from Jupyter?**\n- **Beyond Data Analysis**: Jupyter is great for exploring data, but Flask helps us create interactive web applications that anyone can use.\n- **More Functionality**: Flask lets us add more features and make our app available online.\n\n📚 **What We Learned**:\n1. **Frontend vs. Backend**:\n - **Frontend**: This is what users see and interact with, like the layout, buttons, and text on a webpage.\n - **Backend**: This is the behind-the-scenes part that handles data, logic, and interactions with the server.\n\n2. **Why Introduce Flask?**:\n - **Separation of Concerns**: Flask helps us clearly separate the frontend (what users see) from the backend (how the app works).\n - **Routing**: Flask allows us to map different URLs to specific functions, making it easy to create multiple web pages.\n - **Dynamic Content**: With Flask, we can create web pages that change based on user actions or other inputs.\n - **Server-Side Logic**: Flask lets us handle complex operations on the server, such as database interactions, which Jupyter can’t do as easily.\n\nReady to build more cool web apps?

  "caption": "V3 is here\nBeen making this for a few years but this time its more durable and a lot more portable. I used two different lights, one warm white and one cool white and thus the two switches. Really need good light for the smaller smartphone sensors to showcase my art. And my body just happens to be my longest worked upon art piece🤓\nI’ve used baking sheet as a dispersion medium but for durability I tried plastic sheet this time, pretty cheap. I tried sanding it then bought a frost spray that worked really well but it was kinda fragile and it got glue on it and it basically fucked the whole sheet, for damage control I did a pretty unclean application of a frost sheet instead.\nThe weight was an important factor but I didn’t wanna buy more high powered LEDs, thankfully I had the lights laying around from the previous build, though this time the metal light chassis wasn’t gonna cut it, took it apart and had to desolder and resolder it. My brilliant idea was to glue the acrylic middle to the bottom of the cardboard, obviously that didn’t work and in a few hours it melted the glue and dropped with the melted glue to the base sheet, which is why I had to end up drilling through it and tying it up with wires. Obviously it looks bery DIY, and well, it is.\nBest part is, since it came out so lightweight, i was just able to prop it by throwing wires in and closing cabinet.\n\nIn the future I’d like to buy some tools and get to sheet metal working but I’m not even able to find a vendor that sells them. Another obvious addition is adding a smart switch, this has become the only unsmart object in my room 😔",

  "caption": "Home gym concept🏋️‍♂️💪\nFirstly, yes I’m an idiot for only saving two renders of such an intricate project.\nObviously if you steal this, gimme credit, mostly money or I’ll sue you or something.\nPicture this, in the hight of pandemic I found myself lacking proper gym tools, the amount of equipment I’d need to buy to have a full body workout would be insane, neither did I have the space for them or the floor padding to save the tiles from said weight.\nBiggest innovation here was the side channels that allows you to attach one or multiple resistance bands, all with different resistances, thus allowing for proper progressive overload while keeping the equipment very compact and safe.\nThe seat shown here is retractable and the whole thing can pivot and collapse to become a single pillar. It has few pulleys at the top and few at the bottom so the resistance can technically be directed in any direction.\nNow lets come to the basic functionality, obviously in the bench position you can lay down and use the pulleys at the bottom to have a chest fly/press movement, if the pulleys from the top with the pullup handle ( detachable, for pullups normally) is used, it can become a lat pulldown machine. There’s pulleys in the middle to redirect the resistance horizontally, so with the bench it becomes a rowing motion. With the bench collapsed, the lower pulleys can be used for good mornings, bicep curls, side lat raises etc. Similarly top pulleys can be used for triceps, face pulls etc. \nBut wait what about legs!\nThe bench is telescopic for a reason, the resistance can break attached to the collapsed bench and the telescopic part becomes the moving part, the legs become shoulder rest and voila you have a squat machine. Can also be used for calf raises.\nI think this has a lot of potential if we’re able to make it with adjustable pulley system.\n\nI’m travelling so I don’t know if I have the CAD file with me but if I do, I’ll post better renders later.",
