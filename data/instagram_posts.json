Then used python to understand and visualise it, finally the python scripts checks the amplitude and volume under the graph to classify different reps.\nElectromyography (EMG) is a technique used to measure and analyze the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles, providing valuable insights into muscle health, performance, and neuromuscular function.\n\n- Non-invasive measurement: Surface EMG sensors capture muscle activity through electrodes placed on the skin.\n- Muscle performance: Helps assess muscle strength, fatigue, and coordination.\n- Clinical applications: Used in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders and guiding rehabilitation.\n- Sports and fitness: Monitors muscle engagement and optimization during workouts.\n- Research and development: Crucial for studying muscle function and developing advanced prosthetics and control systems.",
