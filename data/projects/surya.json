Constantly checking time zones on my phone felt disconnected and impersonal. The limitation was clear: screens show time, but not presence. Surya was built to make their daily rhythms visible at a glance."

More than a prototype, it became a personal artifact that made distance legible and emotionally present. The project established my approach to translating abstract feelings into physical interaction, using motion and form instead of screens to communicate meaning.",
