        "text": "Smart lighting has optimized control but removed interaction. Most lamps are reduced to sliders, presets, or voice commands, making light feel passive and disposable. I wanted to design a lamp where changing light felt intentional and physical, something you engage with using your hands, not an app. The constraint was to make the mechanism visible, understandable, and satisfying rather than hidden."
